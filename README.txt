R Code for Glazer et al. (2025) manuscript on modeling rounded NFL yardage data

- `single.script.R`:  Fits model to single player data and creates inference results and graphics
	- `single.rd.norm.R`:  MCMC algorithm for single player model with rounded normal 
	- `single.rd.ald.R`:  MCMC algorithm for single player model with rounded ALD 
	- `single.ppc.R`:  Model checking code for posterior predictive checks using skewness and kurtosis 

- `multi.script.R`:  Fits model to multi player data and creates inference results and graphics
	- `multi.rd.norm.R`:  MCMC algorithm for multi player model with rounded normal 
	- `multi.rd.ald.R`:  MCMC algorithm for multi player model with rounded ALD 

- `nfl.data.script.R`: Generates NFL data, including nfl-rb-pbp-rushing.csv
	- `nfl-rb-pbp-rushing.csv`:  Data set based on NFL running backs for 2023 season.  Each script above performs additional subsetting of the data to restrict it to regular season and omit missing values.   

Note:  The multiplayer MCMC algorithms require hours to fit to this data set.
